Assignment 08 - Basic Shaders
=============================

In this assignment, BasicVertex is replaced by the use of arrays with hard-coded indices for the position and color of a vertex.

An identity vertex shader will know the correct coordinate is at index 0, and a basic fragment shader likewise will know the color is found at index 1.

## Requirements

* Extend your RenderBuffer.js code to be able to handle [index.html](08/ifiles/index.html) without modifying it.
* Make it so the results are the same as in the last assignment.

## Self-Assessment

* I wrote some code for this assignment.
* I found the requirement to not modify index.html suggests that the two shaders be defined as "constructors" in an IdentityShaders.js file.
* I noticed I needed to pass the correct index into each shader's constructor.
* I noticed I needed to store the index in order to use it in each shader's main function.
* I found it interesting that I can define main in the body of a function without the prototype keyword.
* My new RenderEngine's drawPoints function uses the shaders passed to it to find the vertices' positions (in NDC) and colors.
* My output looks like the supplied image.
