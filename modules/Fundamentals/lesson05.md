Composite Matrix
================

* Talk about the last assignment, Shear and Translation
* Multiply row and column vectors, multiply in order
  * 1x3 * 3x1 = 1x1
  * 3x1 * 1x3 = 3x3
  * 3x3 * 1x3 NOT OK
  * 1x3 * 3x3 = 1x3
  * In general, mxn * nxp = m*p works.
* Scale about a different offset, 3 matrices
  * scaling about the origin is easy, but it takes 3 matrices to scale about a different point.
* Applying the matrices in order
* Multiply the matrices, consider the order
* Give the assignment (05)
* What Matthew Carter has to teach us (TED talk -- My Life in Typefaces)
