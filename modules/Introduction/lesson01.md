Lesson 01 - Introduction to Graphics
====================================

* [Rods and Cones](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yLfm5HsHc) - Intro to Color Theory in Graphics
* How did the assignment go?  Where did you get stuck? (If you did not do it, you had better have a question now.)
  * Javascript and HTML, any problems there?  Anyone brand new to that?
  * Any problems with the requirements or other things?
  * Render Buffer
  * Windowing System
* Some more vocabulary to talk about...
  * Color Theory - Color Spaces, e.g. RGB, CMYK, HSV (HSB)
  * Rendering Systems
    * non real time, e.g. Ray Tracing, [Radiosity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosity_(computer_graphics))
    * real time, e.g. polygonal rasterizing, voxels (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W4hawfuOLg)
  * IDE (Integrated Development Environment), e.g. Visual Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans, (lots of others), or ad hoc.
  * Languages & Scripting Languages, e.g. C++, Objective C, Java, Javascript, Lua, etc.
  * The GPU / CPU interaction, programmable GPU's (we are all CPU's with our own buffers, very slow but own it ALL!)
  * Core Graphics Libraries, OpenGL and DirectX
  * Bindings to the various languages, e.g. JOGL
  * Windowing Systems (Toolkits), e.g. SDL, Swing, AWT, glut (specific to OpenGL)
  * API (Application Programming Interface), Toolkits - Libraries that you can work with in your language of choice.
* The next assignment - Choose Your Weapons (Derek's choice: OpenTk, off-limits: Haskell and WebGL)
* Just what level are we talking about in Graphics?
  * Are we artists?
  * Using a graphics application versus writing a graphics application
  * Applications (e.g. [Maya](http://usa.autodesk.com/maya/), [LightWave](https://www.lightwave3d.com/), [Blender](http://www.blender.org/), also has scripting for an engine)
  * Application Development Environments (Game Engines, e.g., [Unity](http://unity3d.com/))
  * Scene Graph libraries, (e.g. [OpenSceneGraph](http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg))
  * Building applications on the core libraries (where we are)
  * Stuff that the devs at NVIDIA do
* [3D Rendering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_rendering)
  * Rasterize - To determine the colors to set pixels in a Render Buffer
  * X, Y, and Z. Which way is UP?
  * "let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth" handed-ness
  * Primitives, points, lines, and polygons
  * focal point, picture plane
