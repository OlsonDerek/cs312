Grades
======

In this class grades are based on attendance, assignments, and a project. This is a programming class, so there will be LOTS of programming. There will be no tests, and there will be very few assignments that do not require programming.

## Attendance - 10%

Everyone starts with a 99.5% score for attendance. Each time you are tardy (after the opening prayer), the score is squared. For each absence, the score is cubed. There are no make-ups.

## Assignments - 40%

Assignments are usually given as a part of each class period and usually involve some programming. Assignments may have varying point values depending on their complexity. They are generally due at the beginning of the next class, but will NOT be turned in. Instead, YOU will grade your own work using an I-Learn "What is True?" check-box assessment. The TA will perform random inspections of students' growing portfolios of completed assignments.

## Exploratory Assignments

This class continues to evolve. Some of the assignments are based on things studied in previous semesters and some things we explore and learn as we go, so the requirements and expectations may not always be fixed. You will always have a clear idea of the complete requiurements at least one class period before the assignment is due. Most of the time, there will be an exemplary implementation of the assignment (written by Brother Pingry). In these cases, we will discuss the implementation of the assignment during a class period before it is due, but only answers to specific questions asked by class members will be given. It will behoove you to take your best stab at something before coming to class that period so that you can ask questions about the specific areas where you are stuck.

Some assignments may involve writing your own code from scratch and some may involve completing code that has been stubbed for you. Assignments should be largely independent of each other. They are usually canned examples of implementing certain features. Assignments are to be completed individually --- no group work is permitted.

## Project - 50%

Projects are a golden opportunity to apply the concepts learned in the assignments and in the classroom discussion. Whereas the assignments may be built upon provided source code, and are mostly independent of each other, projects are written from scratch and allow you to incorporate your own design aesthetics and standards, which will greatly help or hinder progress as the project grows in scope. Some guidance will be given on the scope and requirements of the projects, but for the most part the projects are all about you working on something that is exciting to you. Choose a language and windowing system that is exciting and comfortable, NOT the one used in the assignments.

In your project you will apply what you are learning about fixed pipeline and shader development in OpenGL. There will be some standard requirements based on some common OpenGL principles, but you will then be able to expand on a variety of techniques and effects a la carte. This project will be presented as a part of the final exam of the class.

You are allowed to group for your projects, but each student should have a thorough understanding of the project implementation and details. If you desire to group for projects, please make that clear early on. Students in groups will be asked to review each other for a part of the grade, and you will be asked lots of questions about implementation details during your one-on-one reviews.

## One-on-one Reviews

One of the objectives of the class is to provide feedback and code reviews. The TA or Brother Grimmett will be meeting with each student informally for around fifteen minutes in a one-on-one review while you are working on your project, and again at its conclusion. If it's a group project, he will be evaluating each student's understanding of the project as of that time, and will discuss code organizational ideas and the use of tools, and any stumbling blocks causing grief, but beyond that the review is about giving feedback, not a grade. These reviews are mandatory --- missing a review will drop the grade for the project by one letter grade.
