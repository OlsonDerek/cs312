Lesson 02 - Debugging
=====================

Some thoughts from Brother Pingry about debugging and implementing an algorithm...

1. Never blindly copy anyone's code, even Brother Pingry's. I make mistakes too, and what is the point if you don't really understand it?
2. Use the best tools you can. Text editors that highlight errors. Browsers that show the javascript error.
3. Simplify back to where you understand, then build incrementally. Don't just try to write everything cold and expect it to run the first time.
4. Javascript failures are a pain, but that happens sometimes.
5. Debugging graphics is hard. A zillion alert messages?  Use console.log instead.

Other debugging ideas from the group?
