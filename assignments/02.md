02 Assignment - Choose Your Weapons
=============

### Requirements

* Choose the IDE, language, toolkit, and other libraries you are going to use in your OpenGL project this semester.
* Choose a system that can handle OpenGL and shaders.
* Google around and find some links about how it all works.
* Pretend that you were teaching the class and you need to give a few links as a roadmap to some of your students on how to create an OpenGL window with shaders. (You don't have to implement anything on this assignment, just look around to start getting a clue.)
* If you get lost, ask the questions you need to ask to get found again.

### Self-Assessment

What is true?

* Whatever I did, it was done on time.
* I did next to nothing.
* What's more, I started to think about my choices, so I tried.
* What's more, I succeeded in finding some web pages, but probably not enough to get started.
* What's more, I provided plenty of links someone can follow with a little instruction and deep questions about how things work.
* I feel confident in walking through the websites to get some examples.
* I can show my own screenshots of something I was able to compile and run (even if I do not understand all the code).
