Assignment 04 - Shear and Translation
=====================================

### Requirements

* Explain how a translate and a shear are related, as if you were trying to teach someone.
* Specifically, explain how a translate operation (i.e., translation) could be considered a shear in one dimension higher. In other words:
  * A translate in 1D is a shear in 2D.
  * A translate in 2D is a shear in 3D.
  * A translate in 3D is a shear in 4D.

To get you started, imagine you were an ant on the surface of a coffee table. The surface of the coffee table is your 2D world (XY). What would happen if the table were one unit off the ground (Z), and you did an XY Shear along Z? What is the resulting matrix?

Here is [a website](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mcbryan/5229.03/mail/55.htm) that talks a bit more about shearing.

Just take a stab at trying to explain it to someone.

### Self-Assessment

What is true?

* I read the information at the supplied website.
* I am reasonably confident I could explain what shearing is.
* I can explain how a translate and a shear are related.
* I can show the resulting matrix of an XY shear one unit along Z.
