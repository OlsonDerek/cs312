Assignment 09 - Matrix Transform Vertex Shader
==============================================

## Requirements

* Extend your own code base to show the use of a Matrix Transform shader as discussed in class.

* Use this [index.html](09/ifiles/index.html) file as an example.
* Your code need not look exactly like the example (although it can if you want).
  * Just make sure you can use your engine with a vertex shader that multiplies the vertex position by the matrix to get the coordinates in NDC.
  * Also make sure the vertex positions are now in vec4 form.
  * For some reason, you cannot pass in the function alone when using something bigger than a native type, so you have to pass in the entire instance and call its main.

## Self-Assessment

* I separated my matrix*vector into some other function or class (outside of the vertex shader) so that it could be reused.
* I came up with an example matrix (besides the identity) where I can determine the expected output, and am ready to share it with the class.
* I tested my code with the matrix that I thought up and got the expected result.
* I made a Matrix Transform Vertex shader (even if I didn't call it that).
* I used my new vertex shader in my own HTML with an identity matrix so that it ended up being called in my RenderEngine class.
* My code compiles and runs as expected.
* My code has good naming and coding style.
