Lesson 09 Vertex Shader, Matrix Mult and Orthographic Projections
=================================================================

* Make a vertex shader take a matrix multiply
  * Start with an identity matrix
  * How to do a vector/matrix multiply?
    * Need to have homogeneous coordinates
* Orthographic Projections
  * Remind about the different spaces
  * Derive the matrix given l, r, t, b, n, f
  * Use aspect ratio to build an O. P.
