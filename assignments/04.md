Assignment 04 - Composite Matrix
=============

### Requirements

* Find the 3 matrices that are used to create the composite matrix for rotating in 2D 30 degrees by an offset of (12, 6).
* Multiply these together to get the composite matrix.
* Multiply the composite matrix by the points:
  * (12, 6)
  * (10, 7)
  * (14, 7)
  * (14, 5)
  * (10, 5)
* Graph the results.
* Graph the original as well.

* I multiplied the 3 matrices together correctly.
* I applied the composite matrix to the 1st point.
* I applied the composite matrix to the 2nd point.
* I applied the composite matrix to the 3rd point.
* I applied the composite matrix to the 4th point.
* I applied the composite matrix to the 5th point.
